# Olympics - Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Olympics data from the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 until 2016. Using various data visualization techniques and tools, this project offers insights into medal tallies, overall statistics, country-wise performances, and athlete-wise achievements. The analysis is presented through a web application built with Streamlit, making it interactive and user-friendly.

## Project Description

The Olympics Analysis project explores historical data of the Olympic Games, focusing on key metrics such as:

- **Medal Tally:** Overall and year-wise analysis of medals won by countries.
- **Country-wise Performance:** In-depth analysis of individual countries' performances over the years.
- **Athlete-wise Analysis:** Highlighting the achievements of top athletes across different sports.
- **Category-wise Analysis:** Distribution of medals and participation in various sports categories.

The data has been preprocessed and analyzed using Python, and the visualizations are created with Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The web application allows users to explore the data through interactive plots and dashboards.
